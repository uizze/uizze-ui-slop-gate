## Catch UI Slop in Every Pull Request

Your tests can pass while the UI still looks generated. This free GitHub Action catches concrete finish risks in changed frontend code before they ship. It runs entirely inside the job: no source, screenshots, or scan results leave the runner.

It checks changed JS, TS, JSX, TSX, CSS, HTML, Vue, and Svelte files for conservative signals:

- explicitly inert or placeholder controls;
- data-driven UI with no visible loading, empty, or error-state markers;
- hardcoded color values that may bypass semantic design tokens; and
- combinations of generic dashboard, card-grid, and placeholder-metric cues.

Findings appear as workflow annotations and in the job summary. It is a focused source check, not a visual, accessibility, correctness, or security audit.

## Usage

Pin a released version rather than a branch:

```yaml
name: UI finish gate

on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  ui-slop-gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2
      - uses: uizze/uizze-ui-slop-gate@v1
        with:
          fail-on: error
```

The action needs no token, account, API key, write permission, or network access. For stronger supply-chain pinning, replace `@v1` with the release commit SHA.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `files` | changed frontend files | Optional comma- or newline-separated local paths. |
| `manifest` | none | Optional path to local evidence JSON. |
| `fail-on` | `error` | Fail on `error`, `warning`, or `never`. |
| `show-uizze-link` | `true` | Offer the free UIZZE visual second opinion after useful results. |
| `max-files` | `200` | Scan cap, limited internally to 1–1000. |

Each file is capped at 1 MiB. Generated, dependency, build, and vendor folders are ignored. Explicit paths are also constrained to the checked-out workspace.

## Optional review evidence

A manifest can name files and record product states that reviewers verified elsewhere. Evidence only affects the missing-state check; it does not silence other rules.

```json
{
  "files": ["src/app/orders/page.tsx"],
  "evidence": {
    "src/app/orders/page.tsx": {
      "states": ["loading", "empty", "error"]
    }
  }
}
```

```yaml
- uses: uizze/uizze-ui-slop-gate@v1
  with:
    manifest: .github/uizze-ui-evidence.json
```

## Rule philosophy

The Action reports observable source signals, not subjective design scores. A single `Dashboard` heading does not trigger the generic-dashboard rule; multiple independent cues must appear together. Missing-state checks only run on files that both render UI and contain a data-driven marker. Start with `fail-on: error`, review warnings, and tune the source or evidence rather than blindly suppressing findings.

## Development

Node 20 or newer is enough for local development; GitHub runs the packaged Action on Node 24. There are no production or development dependencies.

```bash
npm test
npm run verify
```

`npm run build` copies the dependency-free source tree into `dist/`. Any release must include the rebuilt `dist/` because GitHub Actions does not run an install or build step for consumers.

Release verification runs in the separate [UIZZE Action Verification](https://github.com/uizze/uizze-action-verification) repository. Keeping that workflow outside this package preserves GitHub Marketplace eligibility while retaining an independently reproducible release check.

## Privacy and security

The runtime reads only local event metadata, Git history, explicitly selected source files, and an optional local manifest. It contains no HTTP client and performs no network transmission. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting and hardening guidance.
